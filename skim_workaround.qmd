WELCOME!

\

\

For my work at MDI, we have this huge dataset of 220k coal mining incidents that were reported.

We want to do a deep dive into everything and figure out what we can. Shiny is a huge asset to this process, but so are you! Let's look at what we've got, what I found, and then let you explore on your own!

\

First, let's take a quick tour of the raw dataset using the `skimr` package. Then, follow me over to the "What I found" page with the results of my analysis on it.

\

\

```{r echo = FALSE, output = TRUE}

coal <- read_rds('data/raw_coal_data.rds')

skim(coal)
```
