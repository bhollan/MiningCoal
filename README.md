This is a project showcase for two courses at Georgetown.

IMPLEMENTATION

Just clone the repo, run `library(shiny)` and then `runApp()` in your R console in RStudio. You'll probably have to install a ton of libraries in the first run, but everything should be here. I've never used `git lfs` before, but afaik, it's indistinguishable.
